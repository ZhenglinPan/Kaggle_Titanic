# Kaggle Titanic Competition

This is my Kaggle lead-in project for Titanic competition, also course project for CMPUT 566.

Project homepage: [ZhenglinPan/Kaggle_Titanic](https://github.com/ZhenglinPan/Kaggle_Titanic)

Competition homepage: [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview)

The project is mainly composed of two parts:
- Stage 1: Feature Engineering
- Stage 2: Model Building

In stage 1, some feature engineering tricks are carried out on the training data provided by Kaggle, including missing values processing, binary cross combination, polynomialization and other features derivation methods.

In stage 2, various models will be explored to produce the best results. 

A XGBoost has been implemented by myself in `models` folder.
